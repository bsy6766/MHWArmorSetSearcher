## About this project/repo
This is a source code of my own project called Monster Hunter World Armor Set Searcher (MHWASS),  
which searches all possible armor sets (armor, charm, decorations) when desired skills or skill sets are given by the user.  

This project supported the game until the before Final Fantasy collaboration came out,  
which I stopped playing MHW due to personal reasons.  

I have no plan to update this project further since there are many 'better' alternative solutions out there.  

Hence, the source code is not maintained at all,  
you might see some questionable codes here and there,   
as I didn't have a time to spend on refactoring and cleaning up.

Windows 10  
Visual Studio  
C++
